This project is an API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) to learn how to build modular and scalable REST APIs while integrating tools like Docker and MongoDB.

---

## üìö Objective

To progressively learn NestJS by building a API called "Pockedex", practicing the use of Docker, MongoDB integration, DTOs, and best practices in API development.s

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **NestJS**
- **TypeScript**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuzmaryporras/nest-pokedex.git
cd nest-pokedex
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Have nest instaled:

```bash
 npm i -g  @nestjs/cli
```

4. Upload database

```bash
 docker-compose up -d
``` 

5. Open in browser or use Postman at http://localhost:3000
6. ‚úÖ Execute the Seed to Fill the Database

You can run the seed by visiting the following endpoint:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/seed
``` 

This will populate the database with sample Pok√©mon data.


## üì¨ Postman Collection

All available API requests are included in a Postman collection so you can test them easily.

üìÅ File path:

```bash
postman/pokedex.postman_collection.json
```

You can import this file into Postman to test endpoints like:

```bash
GET /pokemon/:term

GET /pokemon/?limit=5&offset=10 - Pagination

POST /pokemon

PATCH /pokemon/:term

DELETE /pokemon/:id

GET /seed ‚Äì Populate the database with sample data
